# Ether

[![Mentioned in Awesome Vapor](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/Cellane/awesome-vapor)
![Built with Swift 4.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/swift-4.2-orange.svg)


## What is it?

Ether is a CLI the integrates with SPM (Swift Package Manager), similar to NPM's command-line tool.


## How do I install it?

With Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap Ether-CLI/tap
brew install ether
```

If you don't have, want, or can't use Homebrew, you can run the following script to install Ether:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calebkleveter/Ether/master/install.sh | bash
```

## What features does it have?

### Search:

Searches for available packages:

    ether search <name>
    
Example result:

```
Searching [Done]
vapor/vapor: ðŸ’§ A server-side Swift web framework.
License: MIT License
Stars: 13906

vapor/toolbox: Simplifies common command line tasks when using Vapor
License: MIT License

...    
```

### Install

Installs a package with its dependencies:

    ether install <name>

Example output:

```
Installing Dependency [Done]
ðŸ“¦  10 packages installed
```

Package.swift:

```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/console.git", from: "3.0.0"),
    .package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/core.git", from: "3.0.0"),
    .package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/vapor.git", from: "3.0.0") <=== Added Package
]
```

**Note:**

The install command has a rather interesting method of getting the proper package. Because you can have packages with the same name by different authors, Ether will run a search based on the argument you pass in and get the most stared result. If the name contains a slash (`/`), then the URL will be created directly without a search like this:

    https://github.com/<NAME>.git

Note that this is case insensitive.

### Fix Install

    ether fix-install

```
This may take some time...
